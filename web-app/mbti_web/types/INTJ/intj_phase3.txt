Phase III INTJs wise up to the tricks and temptations of the inferior function, discovering more sustainable ways of integrating their functions. Rather than leapfrogging between the dominant and inferior functions (e.g., the bipolar behavior characteristic of Phase II), they learn to stay grounded in their Ni as they explore, develop, and integrate their less conscious functions.
INTJs in Phase III also become skilled in achieving what psychologist Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi has dubbed the “flow state.” Flow states are characterized by deep absorption in an activity, an optimal balance of challenge and stimulation, and a sense of progress toward a meaningful goal. In a state of flow, INTJs forget about themselves and their concerns, “becoming one with” the activity. Flow states are most likely to emerge when INTJs perform activities that engage their dominant and auxiliary functions. For more on this, see my eBook, The 16 Personality Types.
