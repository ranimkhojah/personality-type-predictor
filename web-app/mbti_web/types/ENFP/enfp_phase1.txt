Extending from early childhood into adolescence, Phase I involves the development and strengthening of the dominant function, Extraverted Intuition (Ne). ENFPs spend much of Phase I developing and differentiating their dominant Ne. While tending to remain open-minded and curious throughout their lives, this is especially pronounced during this phase of their development. Beyond the requirements of school, Phase I ENFPs are generally free to sit back and absorb the world without undue worry or concern. This grants their Ne ample time to form extensive connections and associations. ENFPs may further expand their horizons through any number of means: reading, travel, the arts, engaging with people, etc. This exploratory phase may continue well into their twenties.
