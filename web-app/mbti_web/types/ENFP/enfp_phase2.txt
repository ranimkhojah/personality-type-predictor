Once the dominant function reaches a certain threshold of strength and dominance, ENFPs’ inferior function, Introverted Sensing (Si), enters the picture and begins to play a more influential role. This can be confusing because the inferior is not next in line for development in the functional stack, but the inferior’s undue influence derives from its bipolar relationship with the dominant function. Phase II ENFPs are also working to develop their auxiliary function, Introverted Feeling (Fi). They use their Fi to refine and clarify their values, worldview, and identity. The process of “finding themselves” entails both inner (Fi) and outer (Ne) exploration. Their Fi also helps them weigh and evaluate the needs and wishes of their dominant versus their inferior function. As ENFPs develop and utilize their Fi, they may become more serious, focused, ambitious, and goal-oriented.
