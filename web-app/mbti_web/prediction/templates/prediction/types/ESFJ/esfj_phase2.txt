While the inferior function is not entirely dormant or inert in Phase I, the epic tug-of-war between the dominant and inferior does not come to the fore until Phase II. Once ESFJs’ dominant Fe reaches a certain threshold of strength and dominance, their inferior function, Introverted Thinking (Ti), begins to assert itself and play a more prominent role. This can be somewhat confusing since Ti is not next in line in ESFJs’ functional stack. However, this can be understood as deriving from Ti’s bipolar relationship with ESFJs’ dominant Fe.

Phase II ESFJs also show increasing use and development of their auxiliary function, Introverted Sensing (Si), and may even begin to tap into their tertiary function, Extraverted Intuition (Ne). These Perceiving functions allow ESFJs to open and modify their Fe judgments. They help them loosen their grip on life, tempering their Fe drive for outer order and control.
