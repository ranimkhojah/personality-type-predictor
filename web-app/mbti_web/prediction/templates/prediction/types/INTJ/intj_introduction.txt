The INTJ personality type’s signature strength is deep perception. Otherwise known as “the mastermind,” the INTJ is naturally attuned to “the big picture” and cannot help but see how everything is interconnected. Their ability to perceive deep patterns and causal relationships has helped many achieve eminence in science, mathematics, medicine, or other INTJ careers.
Although INTJs are classified as Thinking types, their dominant function is Intuition, or more specifically, Introverted Intuition (Ni). In seeing the world through Ni lenses, their typical mode of operation is well described as impressionistic. Rather than noticing or concerning themselves with the details of the world around them, their existence is more cerebral or dreamlike. This can lead them to feel estranged from their physical environs, not to mention their own bodies.
While INTJs may be relatively unaware of how others perceive them, their “other-worldliness” often earns them labels such as quirky, awkward, nerdy, or oblivious. Onlookers sense that INTJs seem to “live in their own world.” Immersed in their own minds and interests, INTJs can be oblivious to social norms or other practical aspects of life. While incredibly “book smart,” they may fall short when it comes to social or “street smarts.”
At some point in their lives, INTJs start to notice how characteristically different their personality traits are from those of their peers. They may even joke about the nerdy or esoteric nature of their interests. Fortunately, they usually find a few friends with overlapping interests, even if those friendships are largely maintained through what others might consider non-social activities, such as playing video games over the internet.
