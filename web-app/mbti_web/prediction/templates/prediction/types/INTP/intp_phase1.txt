This phase is characterized by the emergence and differentiation of INTPsâ€™ dominant function, Introverted Thinking (Ti). Early in life, INTPs often employ their Ti to focus on one or two pursuits. They may, for instance, use it to master video games, program computers, get good grades, or perfect their 5 K time. Since Ti is a Judging function, INTPs often take themselves and their lives rather seriously. Even from a young age, they can be self-starters, striving for excellence in whatever captures their interests.
