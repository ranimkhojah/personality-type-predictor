Phase I is characterized by the exploration and development of INFPs’ dominant function, Introverted Feeling (Fi). Even as children, INFPs are often “highly sensitive persons” (HSPs). Sensitive to their own feelings, as well as those of others, they feel unsettled and anxious in conflictual situations. This may prompt them to seek refuge in time alone, finding comfort in solitary activities such as daydreaming, reading, drawing, listening to music, etc. Hence, young INFPs come to enjoy exploring their own interests, free from external disruptions.
