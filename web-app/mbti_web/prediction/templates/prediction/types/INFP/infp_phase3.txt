Phase III represents the well-integrated personality. According to Elaine Schallock, integration occurs when the functional stack is consistently used in a “top-down” fashion. By this she means that the functions are best prioritized and utilized in a dominant-auxiliary-tertiary-inferior sequence. If used consistently over time, she suggests the top-down approach will naturally result in greater development and integration of all the functions. In Schallock’s view, “jumping the stack”—trying to appease or satisfy the inferior function directly or through various short-cuts—is rarely a reliable or sustainable means to integration.

The first and probably most important step for INFPs seeking integration is learning how to effectively and routinely transition into Ne perceiving. To understand why this is so critical, we must remember that Fi is not only an introverted function, but also a judging function (all the T and F functions are judging functions). Therefore, counterbalancing Fi requires both extraversion and perceiving. And this is precisely what Ne as an extraverted perceiving function can do for INFPs (refer to our eBook, The 16 Personality Types, for more on this).

Phase III INFPs develop a clearer sense of who they are and how to live authentically and effectively. This allows them to feel more safe, secure, and grounded in themselves as well as, if by some act of magic, in the world.
