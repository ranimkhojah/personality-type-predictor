Once the dominant function reaches a certain threshold of strength and dominance, ENTPs’ inferior function, Introverted Sensing (Si), enters the picture and begins to play a more influential and mischievous role. This can be confusing because the inferior is not next in line for development in the functional stack, but the inferior’s undue influence derives from its bipolar relationship with the dominant function. Unfortunately, the inferior’s influence peaks in Phase II of type development, which happens to be the same time people are making life-altering decisions about their careers and relationships. We discuss ENTPs’ inferior-function related issues later in this profile.

In addition to the increasing presence and influence of Si, Phase II ENTPs are also developing their auxiliary function, Introverted Thinking (Ti). Ti brings greater order and clarity to ENTPs’ ideas, worldview, and identity. As ENTPs develop and utilize their Ti, they may also become more serious, focused, and driven.
