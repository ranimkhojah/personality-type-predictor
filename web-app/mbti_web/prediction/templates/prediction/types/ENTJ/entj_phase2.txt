Once their dominant Te reaches a certain threshold of strength and dominance, ENTJs’ inferior function, Introverted Feeling (Fi), enters the picture and begins to play a more influential role. This can be confusing because Fi is not next in line in their functional stack. Its undue influence derives from its bipolar relationship with ENTJs’ dominant Extraverted Thinking (Te). Unfortunately, the influence of their Te peaks in Phase II of type development, which happens to be the same time they are making life-altering decisions about their careers and relationships. ENTJs’ Te-Fi tug-of-war will be elucidated later in this profile.

In addition to the increasing presence and influence of their Fi, Phase II ENTJs are also developing their auxiliary function, Introverted Intuition (Ni). As they encounter complex problems and situations that call for greater patience and reflection, they turn to their Ni for assistance. In doing so, they work to better see and incorporate the bigger picture (Ni) into their Te Judging process. As they develop their ability to assume different perspectives and to grasp the bigger picture, they become somewhat slower to judge and display more discernment and foresight in their decisions.

Phase II ENTJs may also begin to differentiate and incorporate their tertiary function, Extraverted Sensing (Se). For ENTJs, Se represents a further relaxing and opening of their judgments. It helps them loosen their grip on life, tempering their need for constant outer control (Fe).
