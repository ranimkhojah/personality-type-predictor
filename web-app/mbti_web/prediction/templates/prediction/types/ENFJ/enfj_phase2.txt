Once their dominant Fe reaches a certain threshold of strength and dominance, ENFJs’ inferior function, Introverted Thinking (Ti), enters the picture and begins to play a more influential role. This can be confusing because Ti is not next in line in their functional stack. Its undue influence derives from its bipolar relationship with ENFJs’ dominant Fe. It is somewhat unfortunate that the influence of the inferior peaks in Phase II, when most people are making life-altering decisions about their careers and relationships. ENFJs’ Fe-Ti tug-of-war will be elucidated later in this profile.

In addition to the increasing presence and influence of their Ti, Phase II ENFJs are also developing their auxiliary function, Introverted Intuition (Ni). As they encounter complex problems and situations that call for greater patience and reflection, they turn to their Ni for assistance. In doing so, they become increasingly capable of grasping and incorporating the bigger picture (Ni) into their Fe Judging process. Ni insight may also compel them to rescind or revise some of their previous premature judgments.

Phase II ENFJs may also begin to differentiate and incorporate their tertiary function, Extraverted Sensing (Se). For ENFJs, Se represents a further relaxing and opening of their judgments. It helps them loosen their grip on life, tempering their need for constant outer control (Fe). As their Ni and Se develop, ENFJs take on more Perceiving qualities, displaying more openness, flexibility, and acceptance.
