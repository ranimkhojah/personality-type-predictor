Once their dominant Ti reaches a certain threshold of strength and dominance, ISTPs’ inferior function, Extraverted Feeling (Fe), enters the picture and begins to play a more influential role. This can be confusing because Fe is not next in line in their functional stack. Its undue influence can be understood as deriving from its bipolar relationship with ISTPs’ dominant Ti.

Phase II ISTPs also show increasing use and development of their auxiliary function, Extraverted Sensing (Se). This may involve exploring new hobbies and interests, such as gourmet cooking. As a Perceiving function, Se also leads to an opening of their Ti judgments to see if they pass the test of lived experience. Since Se is an extraverted and expansive function, Phase II ISTPs may feel it necessary to explore a wide range of experiences before arriving at confident conclusions.

Phase II ISTPs may also begin to tap into their tertiary function, Introverted Intuition (Ni), which can subconsciously assist ISTPs in piecing together their Se experiences, further clarifying their identity and worldview.
