Phase I is characterized by the development and rise to power of ISFJsâ€™ dominant function, Introverted Sensing (Si). ISFJs use their Si to absorb, integrate, and reflect on acquired information and personal experiences. Since Si corresponds with memory and recall, ISFJs can amass a great deal of information in Phase I.

Phase I ISFJs may also show some development of their auxiliary function, Extraverted Feeling (Fe), which can serve as a helpful extraverted tool for navigating and managing the outside world.
